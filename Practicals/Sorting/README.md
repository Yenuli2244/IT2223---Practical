# Sorting Algorithms in MATLAB
## Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of three classic sorting algorithms in MATLAB:
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort

Each algorithm sorts a predefined array and prints the result. These examples help understand how each sorting technique works internally.

## Algorithms Implemented
- ### 1. Bubble Sort
**Logic:**
- Repeatedly compares adjacent elements.
- Swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- Continues until the list is sorted.

- ### 2. Insertion Sort
**Logic:**
- Builds the sorted array one item at a time.
- Inserts each element into its correct position relative to the already sorted part of the array.


- ### 3. Selection Sort
**Logic:**
- Repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted part.
- Places it at the beginning of the sorted part by swapping.
