# ðŸ“Œ Sorting Algorithms in MATLAB
## Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of three classic sorting algorithms in MATLAB:
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort

Each algorithm sorts a predefined array and prints the result. These examples help understand how each sorting technique works internally.

## Algorithms Implemented
- ### 1. Bubble Sort
   **Logic:**
  - Repeatedly compares adjacent elements.
  - Swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
  - Continues until the list is sorted.

- ### 2. Insertion Sort
   **Logic:**
  - Builds the sorted array one item at a time.
  - Inserts each element into its correct position relative to the already sorted part of the array.

- ### 3. Selection Sort
   **Logic:**
  - Repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted part.
  - Places it at the beginning of the sorted part by swapping.
