# MATLAB Sorting Algorithms

## ðŸ“Œ 1. Bubble Sort

### âœ… Description
Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the list is sorted.

## ðŸ“Œ 2. Insertion Sort

### âœ… Description
Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It works similarly to sorting playing cards in your hand, where each new card is placed in its correct position relative to the already sorted cards.
