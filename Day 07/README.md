# 🔍 Linear vs Binary Search --> LinearBinary.m

### Description
This script compares the performance of:
- **Linear Search**: Scans the array element-by-element.
- **Binary Search**: Efficient search for sorted arrays by dividing the array into halves.

### Key Concepts
- **Linear Search** time complexity: `O(n)`
- **Binary Search** time complexity: `O(log n)`
- Demonstrates the use of `tic` and `toc` for timing

# 🔁 Selection Sort --> SelectionSort.m
### Description
This script sorts an array using the Selection Sort algorithm, which repeatedly finds the minimum element and swaps it to its correct position.

### Key Concepts
- Time complexity: ```O(n^2)```
- Good for learning purposes, but not efficient for large datasets
